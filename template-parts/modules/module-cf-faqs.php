                        A return is made if the business you have backed goes on to achieve an ‘exit’ (via a sale to another company or by floating on the stock market) at a higher value than when you invested - you make a profit from your investment. 
                        Just remember that investing in a startup business carries significant risks, including illiquidity, lack of dividends, loss of your investment and dilution.
